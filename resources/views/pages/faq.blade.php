                                                <strong>Hi there.</strong> My name is Anas omar, and I've been part of
                                                the Laravel community since the early days of version 3. am a co-host of
                                                the Laravel podcast, created popular packages, written countless
                                                tutorials,
                                                recorded courses for Tuts+, and have even written a popular book, called
                                                Laravel Testing Decoded. Additionally, I've contributed (often, in some
                                                cases) to the two most popular web development print magazines in the

                                                .Net and Web Designer.
                                                <br><br> Most importantly, though, I know how to explain complicated
                                                subjects. I've spent many years learning how to do this. It's not easy,
                                                but, if you're struggling, I can help better than anyone.

                                                Most companies spend thousands on marketing to tell the world about
                                                their products. EducationForFree spends zero; we rely entirely on word
